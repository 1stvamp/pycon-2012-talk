Original notes
---
I originally wrote the talk in the passenger seat of a Ford Focus traveling back and forth down the M62 over the course of 4 weekends. You can see these notes in the `notes.md` file, I used this file to assemble the final slides but they're a bit all over the place.

Illustrations
---
The images for my slides are by my friend and sometime partner-in-crime [Jonathan "Joffie" Oliver](http://about.me/joffie), but I didn't end up using all the illustrations due to having too many slides. You can view **all** the images he drew for in the `images` directory (and you really should).
